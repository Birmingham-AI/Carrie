      "WHY \"Imagine if we could safely train AI to operate in the real world — without risk, without cost, and without limits. That’s what Google’s new Genie 3 represents. It gives AI a playground the size of the universe, where it can practice endlessly before stepping into our world.\"",
      "WHAT \"Genie 3 is what’s called a world model. Instead of generating static text or images, it creates full 3D, interactive environments from a simple text prompt. If I type in ‘a busy kitchen’ or ‘a construction site,’ Genie 3 instantly produces a virtual space where AI can interact, experiment, and learn.”",
      "HOW \"Here’s how it works: ● You start with a text description. ● Genie 3 transforms it into a 3D, interactive simulation. ● AI agents can then move through that space, pick things up, solve problems, and learn through trial and error — just like humans do. And because it’s virtual, we can scale this to millions of training scenarios, far beyond what’s possible in the real world.”",
      "WHAT IF \"So what does this mean for us? What if every robot could practice in simulation before ever touching the real world? What if industries could test safety procedures, logistics, or even medical training in limitless virtual environments? What if cities like Birmingham could use tools like Genie 3 to both upskill workers and safely innovate with AI?\""
